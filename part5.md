### Part 2 Discussion

#### What would be a really simple solution if n were not an argument, i.e., if it were always 17?

A really simple solution if n were not an argument would be to hard code the variable value into the code by declaring the integer variable "n" as n = 17.
An even simplier answer would be to print out each integer individually and simply replace the values with the desired output of "Fizz", "Buzz", or "FizzBuzz". There would be no need for loops or if statements at that point.


### Part 3 Discussion

#### How could you have automatically tested your initial solution from part 2?




### Part 4 Discussion

#### What changes between parts 2, 3, and 4, and what stays the same? Does it matter what list implementation you choose? If so, in what way(s)?
